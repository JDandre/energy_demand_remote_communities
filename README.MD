## Overview
This was a three-month team project to analyze energy demands in Canadian remote communities. 
The goal of the project was to establish long-term foundations for calculating heating consumption
in these communities by classifying building classifications (Commercial, Residential, Industrial)
and building arch-types (single/mulit-unit housings, garages, factories, etc).
